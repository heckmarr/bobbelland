Hello!

I'm a driven white-hat developer. I cut my teeth in a library setting up public computers
and used that drive to help myself learn development in general. Now I'm in charge of
an ERP system, a logisitics system and strive to learn at every opportunity. I work well
both alone and in a team whether leading it or not. I prefer to lead though.

I look forward to hearing from you,
Bob "Ben" Belland
